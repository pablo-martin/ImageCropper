 # Pablo Image Pipeline  

 Main script is image_pipeline.py. In general, you can point it to a folder with
 pictures in jpg or png format, then a window will pop up allowing you to crop
 subsections of the images. Use left or right arrow to move through your pictures,
 and click and drag box across image to select section to crop, then click to
 save image.

 description of all the parameters that you can supply.
